# NumberProcessing

This is an NVDA add-on to read automatically digit by digit any number of specified length (via settings or quick settings).

For example, with default minimum number length of 2, enabling digit processing you'll hear 42 as  four two, 338 as three three eight, etc; setting number length on 4, instead, you'll hear 338 as usual, but 1337 as one three three seven. 

In addition, from settings, you can also enable the autostart of digit processing for current profile.

Inspired by [an experimental work of Derek Riemer.][1]

Compatible with NVDA 2017.3 and above, download it [here.][2]

* NVDA+shift+l (once): enable/disable digit processing;
